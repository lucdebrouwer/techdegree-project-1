# techdegree-project-1

Project 1's goal was set to familiarising object oriented JS and working with functions. 

On page load, there will always be a random quote that gets selected from an object array. 
Every 30 seconds a new quote will appear, and the backgroundcolor will randomly change. 

Future goals:
* Displaying quotes from a webservice rather than a hardcore object array

Goals achieved:
* Result exceeds expectations.
